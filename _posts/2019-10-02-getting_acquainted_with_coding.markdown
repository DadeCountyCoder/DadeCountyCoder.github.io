So before Flatiron i was absolutley new to the concept of coding, it's one of those types of things that surrounds us and affects us daily yet you are blind to it.My prior job experience has nothing to do with this field so when it was introduced to me i was nervous yet excited.One of the coolest things about coding in Ruby thus far is how flexible you can be when working with it, how .map & .collect will take different routes but get you to the same destination.After 4 weeks of bootcamp I'm still getting use to the idea of coding, having those awkard moments when i dont understand what the specs want from me.A fellow coder explained to me how he loves coding and it means everything to him, I how ever don't feel the same way at least not yet. In a recent conversation with my Educational Coach he asked how I'm feeling about my journey so far and i told him I'm not in love with Coding, I'm not ready to put a ring on it but i feel like we've hung out a couple times and I'm intrigued to see where we go.
