Career wise i've always felt lost...stumbling from job to job seeking and searching for a place where i belonged.I've always been creative and enjoyed drawing and watching cartoons and was interested in a career in gaming.My Journey into coding was inspired by my second born son.One day after school he was very excited to tell me that while at computer lab he used a coding webite for kids to make a game and showed me how it worked.A spark of curiosity of wonderment was ignited and after some research was intrigued by an ad for Career Karma.I then took the precourse for Flatiron and thus my advanture began.
