  A wise friend once told me you know more than you think you do and by the end of my first solo project this sentiment would be proven true.I'm sure that for some of people it was an easy task that took minimal effort however that was not my experience.I've nerver felt so frustrated  and alone in my life!Feeling defeated after endless hours of staring at my computer screen wanting to punt it across the room!

	Wondering why Ruby personally hated me and on the verge of giving up I reminded myself of why I first took on this journey, a new career, a sense of purpose, a better life for my children! Thus began the countless hours of Google searches and Youtube videos.Looking at every possible example i could find and with my project due date fast approaching and passing, pieces of the puzzle started to fall in place.Not fully understading what i was doing but being able to look at it and say that makes sense was incredibly reasurring.Even something as simple as figuring out that .chomp and .strip do basically the same thing but depending on your code you should be more inclined to use one over the other was a win for me.
 
 Example:
 Chomp removes any thing trailing from the string
 "hello\n".chomp                #=> "hello"
 Strip removes any leading or trailing white space
 "  hello  ".strip!  #=> "hello"
 
 This project was full of ups and downs for me and i definitley stumbled and tripped along the way but i continue on my path to become a software engineer developer.
